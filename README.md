# Image-classification-using-NN
this image classification neural network achieves an impressive 85% accuracy in categorizing various images. This model is built with a robust architecture designed to handle complex visual data and is fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer. Adam, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling sparse gradients, ensures that the network converges quickly and reliably.

The model is trained using the 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss function, which is ideal for classification tasks involving multiple categories. This loss function helps the network learn to differentiate between different classes with high precision, even when the classes are imbalanced or have a large number of categories.

With a focus on accuracy and efficiency, this neural network is well-suited for applications requiring high-performance image classification, such as object detection, facial recognition, and image-based search engines. Its high accuracy rate demonstrates its capability to perform reliably in real-world scenarios, making it a valuable tool for developers and researchers in the field of computer vision.
